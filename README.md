  * Practical and comprehensive, Foundations of Addiction Counseling explores an array of techniques and skills that a new practitioner will need in the real world while providing a thorough review of the research, theory, and history of addiction counseling. With chapters written by expert scholars, this text covers many topics in depth often ignored by other comparable books, such as multiple chapters on cross-cultural counseling, professional issues in addictions counseling, the assessment of client strengths, gender issues in substance use, working in rehabilitation centers, and working with clients with disabilities.
 
  * Combining practice, research, and theory, the 4th Edition of this unique text offers students the tools and strategies they need for successful practice. The revised edition includes new case studies, extended discussion in the chapters dedicated to substance and process addictions (Chs. 2-3), a thoroughly updated chapter on maintenance and relapse prevention (Ch. 13), and an expanded chapter on substance use and families (Ch 14).
